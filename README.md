# Hello, World!

I'm Eric Lauber. I'm a licensed Professional Engineer with an MBA living in the Toledo, Ohio area. 

I'm currently working as a Team Leader of Engineering at [Rocket Mortgage](https://www.rocketmortgage.com/) as part of Rocket Mobile Technologies. We build and maintain Rocket Mortgage's suite of mobile product experiences. My responsibilities include working as a [servant leader](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/scrum-master/) for my team and advocate for my team members.
